Clean Architecture advocates for a plugin architecture with dependencies pointing inward, ensuring that details such as databases or web frameworks are treated as mere details, thereby maximizing the software's flexibility. By maintaining a clear separation between policies (business rules) and details (frameworks, databases), the architecture aims to minimize lifetime software costs and facilitate development, deployment, operation, and maintenance. The book also explores various component coupling and cohesion principles, offering metrics for assessing component stability and abstraction. 'Clean Architecture' provides a comprehensive framework for thinking about software architecture that leaves as many options open as possible, for as long as possible, to facilitate easy changes and enhancements over time."
